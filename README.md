# Encryption-Lab
Cyber Security AES Encryption & Decryption Lab by Tyler Watson and Ammanuel Beyene

# Instructions to run
1. Build the program by running the following command from the project directory (via a command line interface): `g++ -o ./aes ./main.cpp`
2. Then run the following command to begin the program:`./aes`
3. You will recieve a prompt to choose either AES encryption or decryption.
4. You will select encryption and then you will need to type the name of the file (we included a test file called "test1.txt" for your use)
6. Then the program will produce the encrypted file called `encrypted_file.txt`
7. Next, you will want to decrypt the outputted encrypted file. You can do this by selecting `2` in the main menu.
8. After responding to the command line prompts, the program will generate a decrypted file called `decrypted_file.txt`
9. You can exit the program by typing `3` in the menu.
