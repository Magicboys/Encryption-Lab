# Encryption-Lab
Cyber Security AES Encryption & Decryption Lab by Tyler Watson and Ammanuel Beyene

# Instructions to run
1. Build the program by running the following command from the project directory (via a command line interface): `g++ std=c++14 -Wall -o cmake-build-debug/Encription_Lab.exe main.cpp`
2. Then run the following command to begin the program:`./Encription_Lab.exe`
3. You will recieve a prompt to choose either AES encryption or decryption.
4. If you select encryption then you will need to type the name of the file (we included a test file called "test1.txt" for your use)
6. Then the program will produce the encrypted file called `output.txt`
7. Next, you will want to decrypt the outputted encrypted file. You can do this by selecting `2` in the main menu.
8. After responding to the command line prompts, the program will generate a decrypted file.
